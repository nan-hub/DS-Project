[Linear Regression to predict Boston Housing](https://github.com/nan-hub/DS-Project/blob/master/Linear%20Regression%20to%20predict%20Boston%20Housing.ipynb)

> python, jupyter notebook

>pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

- Import Boston Housing data from sklearn datasets
- Visualize the data and find the parameters which are highly associated with the housing price
- Split the original data into train and test dataset
- Train the model and provide interpretaion of coefficient
- Predict on the test set and report MAE, MSE and RMSE

[Movie Recommendation with Recommender Systems](https://github.com/nan-hub/DS-Project/tree/master/Movie%20Recommendation%20with%20Recommender%20Systems)
> python, jupyter notebook

>pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

- Create histogram to analysis the number of rateing
- Filter out the movies with less than 100 ratings
- Calculate the correlation between the chosen viewed movie and the other movies
- Recommend the most similar movies (highest correlation)
*Note: This is a simplified model!*

1. [Visualize stock prices](https://github.com/nan-hub/DS-Project/blob/master/Finance%20Project.ipynb)
> python, jupyter notebook

> pandas, saborn, plotly, cufflinks

- Use `pandas_datareader` to fetched the online bank stock data from yahoo finance for Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley
and Wells Fargo
- Visualize the stock returns for each bank and analyze the outstand points
- Create interactive plot with plotly and cufflinks
